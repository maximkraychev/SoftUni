# How this works?

This program is a simple console-base JS game in which your opponent, "the computer" chooses a random number between "1 and 100" and your task is to guess this number. After each of your guesses, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected, **but be careful you have only 3 attempts after that you lose.**
